        description: 'The world we live in is full of uncertainties and impending doom. Preppers, survival-enthusiasts, whatever names the general public may call them have many strategies and procedures in place for ensuring their survival. The store I have created can be a one-stop-shop for those wanting to buy everything they need. The store is not complete and items can be added as need be. This is a cool place to shop and support a local store versus scouring the internet for different shops to buy the same items!',

        subtitle: 'Full Stack MERN App',
        description: 'Full MERN Stack translator app with CRUD functionality. My idea was inspired by our diverse PerScholas cohort with many walks of life. This comes with many new unique phrases being introduced in everyday conversation. While I thought this was an original idea I remembered Urban dictionary already existed, this is essentially a made from scratch Urban dictionary clone. I do not use very many slang terms personally but thought this was a nice shout-out to my friends who use these phrases throughout the course.',
